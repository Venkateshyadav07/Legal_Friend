	<h1>Civil Law in India</h1>
	<p><strong>Introduction to Civil Law in India</strong></p>

    <p>
      Civil law governs private disputes between individuals, organizations, or entities. It is different from criminal law, which deals with offenses against the state. Civil law seeks to resolve non-criminal disputes, such as disagreements over property, contracts, divorce, and other personal matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Constitution of India provides for separate laws to govern civil disputes. The primary laws governing civil disputes in India include:
